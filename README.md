**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

To ensure that my code or software is both functional and secure, I focus on thorough testing, input validation, and following best practices such as writing unit tests, handling exceptions, and avoiding hardcoded sensitive data. Regular testing helps confirm that the program behaves correctly, while validation and error handling protect it from unexpected or malicious input.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

To interpret user needs, I start by carefully reviewing requirements and translating them into clear, testable conditions that the program must satisfy. I also break requirements down into smaller functional pieces so I can verify that each feature works as intended and aligns with what the user actually requested.

**How do I approach designing software?**

When designing software, I take a structured approach by planning the architecture first, choosing appropriate data structures, and outlining how components will interact before writing code. This helps ensure the program is organized, scalable, and easier to maintain or modify later.
